Clustering algorithms group similar data points together based on their features, and anomalies are identified as data points that do not belong to any cluster or belong to a very small cluster. For example, in credit card fraud detection, clustering algorithms can be used to group similar transactions together, and anomalies can be identified as transactions that do not fit the pattern of normal transactions, such as those with unusual purchase amounts or locations.<br>\n",

Density-based methods identify anomalies as data points that have low density or are far away from the high-density areas in the dataset.
